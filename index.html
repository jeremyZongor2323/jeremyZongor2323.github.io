            <h2>About Poverty</h2>
            <p>Poverty is not just about not having enough money. It is a multidimensional issue that concerns a lack of
                education, health, and living standards. The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than
                $2.15 a day.</p>
            <p>It means facing daily challenges to access basic needs such as food, clean water, and shelter.
                Understanding poverty is the first step toward solving it.</p>

            <ul class="cause-list">
                <li><strong>Lack of Education:</strong> Without access to education, people cannot develop the skills
                    needed to find better jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict and Instability:</strong> War and violence destroy infrastructure and force people
                    to flee their homes.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Access to Healthcare:</strong> Poor health can prevent people from working and
                    drains family resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Natural disasters and changing weather patterns affect agriculture,
                    a primary source of income for many.</li>
